Tugas 3 PI
Write a program that reads in integer numbers from a text file named indata.txt in the same directory as the executing program.  

Print the sum of the numbers with comma separators and two digits.

For example if the file has the following data:

10

1000

20

Your program should print 1030.00.

Write a class that calculates and stores the height and weight of a person in metric. The file should be named lab.py.  BMI is calculated using this formula:

Weight/Height^2 - weight is in kilograms and height is in meters.

The class should have two properties named:

Weight

Height

The class should have two methods:

BMI_Value – This takes no arguments and returns a decimal value of the BMI

Equals – This should override the equals method from the object class to compare the weight and height of two BMI objects.  To override the equal method you should implement this method: __eq__(self, other) and return a boolean
